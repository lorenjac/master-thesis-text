Recent advances in non-volatile memory research indicate that fast high-density NVRAM is available in the near future. Based on this prospect, later research found that novel NVRAM can signifantly increase transaction throughput in databases. Still, for performance reasons, many databases resort to relaxed isolation of concurrent transactions. Therefore, this thesis investigates if NVRAM provides sufficient leverage to make the isolation level of serializability affordable.

For that purpose, Midas, an NVRAM-resident key-value store with serializable transactions was developed. The concurrency control  in Midas is based on an extended variant of the MVCC protocol Snapshot Isolation. Non-volatile memory is managed using PMDK, a state of the art library for programming against NVRAM.

In order to evaluate if the concept of this work is worth pursuing, an experiment was conducted. In the experiment, Midas is compared to Echo, another NVRAM-resident KVS but with non-serializable transactions. Both KVS are compared in terms of transaction throughput and abort rate measured with four different synthetic workloads.

* at first, eval shows that index implementation of Midas is inappropriate for a resource shared among many threads
* critical design flaw, lock durations were assumed to be very short
* as a result, performs worse in all but one scenario
* with low contention Midas performs better than Echo but this also the best case scenario

or

* eval shows that Midas has lower throughput than echo in almost all multi-threaded scenarios
* an exception is a low contention scenario where Midas performs significantly better
* in all cases throughput in Midas does not scale with additional processors
* however, in most cases this is not primarily related to higher abort rates [which can even increase throughput values]
* instead the reason is a poor implementation of Midas' index which incurs excessive synchronization overhead
* therefore, an experimental version of midas was benchmarked to approximate the performance of a non-blocking concurrent hash table
* 

The evaluation of the experiment shows that in most cases Midas achieves lower throughput than Echo. 

In some cases this amplified by time-savings from aborting expensive commits. However, in a low-contention scenario Midas has negligible abort rates and still performs better than Echo. This is a significant result because it shows that serializable SI can still perform well in situations where default SI is often preferred over locking. Unfortunately, a poor implementation of the Midas' index structure leads high synchronization overhead which keeps throughput from scaling with additional processors. Therefore, a variant of Midas was benchmarked
