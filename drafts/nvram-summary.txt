NVRAM is a promising technology, especially in storage-bound environments. Until recently, both latencies and capacities had fallen short of expectations. However, recent advances in the manufacture of NVRAM have shown promising results. Technologies such as PCM provide larger capacities than DRAM at comparable latencies.

Apart from other more intricate use cases, recent research shows that MMDB can benefit greatly from NVRAM. While access latencies are comparable to conventional MMDB, NVRAM largely eliminates the need to ensure recoverability on slower mass storage. This enables higher transaction throughput and near-instantaneous restarts.

Still, there are also challenges to be addressed. First, current NVRAM technologies tend to have either high latency, low capacity, or low endurance. Even though PCM is a promising candidate, it is still slower than DRAM, especially when writing. Hence, manufacture still needs significant improvement.
Furthermore, there is, as of this writing, no generally accepted programming model for NVRAM. In general, there is no way for software to determine whether a store has arrived in NVRAM or not. Since CPUs are unaware of any transactional semantics between stores, programmers need to manually ensure consistency for data in NVRAM. Otherwise, a torn write from a crash may lead to irreversible data corruption. As the counter measures presented in this chapter must be applied judiciously as they may incur significant runtime penalties.
