Beyond databases and caches, KVS have also been proposed as a basis for file systems. In the past, there have been several attempts to integrate database concepts into file systems, some of which are logging {rosenblum1992design, tweedie1998journaling} and transactions {seltzer1990transaction, spillane2009enabling}. Some studies even suggest that traditional hierarchical file systems may often be suboptimal {stein2005stupid, seltzer2009hierarchical}. However, databases in general are still considered too heavy for driving file systems {seltzer2009hierarchical}. KVS on the other hand, provide light-weight database that could be used for file systems. Examples include a network file system based on BerkeleyDB {murphy2001database} and FlatFS, a simple file system for NVRAM {volos2014aerie}. In addition, KVS are also used to complement file systems, for example, to store metadata as in PVFS {carns2009small}.
