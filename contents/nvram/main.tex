\chapter{Non-Volatile RAM}
\label{ch:nvram}

Conventional non-volatile memories such as HDD or SSD provide large capacities but are only block-oriented and incur substantial access latencies compared to volatile DRAM. Especially IO-bound applications tend to keep as much data in RAM as possible but are eventually forced to access slower media for durable storage. This led to the development of non-volatile variants of RAM. Recent research suggests that both fast and high-capacity NVRAM will become widely available in the near future.

This chapter gives an overview on the state-of-the-art in NVRAM research.
Included is a discussion of opportunities and challenges, such as the notorious
consistency issues in the presence of failures.

\section{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item this chapter touched several aspects of NVRAM research: ...
    \item the most ingriguing use case in conventional systems are MMDB/KVS
    \item in accordance with recent research, it is assumed that NVRAM complements DRAM instead of replacing it
    \item through hybrid mem arch benefits of both techs can be leveraged
    \item in context of MMDB it seems reasonable to refrain from using conventional non-volatile storage
    \item with PCM a promising technology nears commercial release
    \item concerning integration, it is very likely that NVRAM will be packaged as NVDIMM, so integration patterns are likely to remain largely the same
    \item consistency across crashes is still a prominent issue with NVRAM
    \item however, recent research suggests that a combination of memory barriers, cacheline flushes, and ADR provides a viable solution
    \item still, an open question is the programming model used with NVRAM
    \item as a result, a number of programming models have emerged
    \item in practice, programmers still need to meticulously manage non-volatile data (assignment policy, datastructure recovery, consistency)
    \item but programming models are beyond the scope of this work
\end{itemize}
