\begin{itemize}
    \item 4 x Intel Xeon CPU E7 4830 @ 2.13GHz
    \item each CPU has 8 cores with two-way SMT (total 64 hardware threads)
    \item 256GB DDR3 @ 1066MHz
    \item 7.7 TB HDD
    \item 127GB non-swappable tmpfs partition
    \item persistence is achieved via storing database as a file in tmpfs (for both KVS)
    \item tmpfs files are mapped into memory
    \item in accordance with \cite{bailey2013exploring, zhou2016nvht} this work refrains from emulating access latencies of NVRAM of the same reasons given in the previous section.
\end{itemize}
