The benchmarks are conducted on a platform of four Intel Xeon E7-4830 processors
with a total of 32 cores running at 2.13GHz. Main memory consists of 256GB DDR3
\ac{DRAM} running at 1066Mhz. For durable storage, the system relies on
mechanical hard drives. The operating system is CentOS 7.4 based on Linux 3.10.

Since \ac{NVRAM} is not available, all benchmarks are carried out on volatile
\ac{DRAM}. In order to emulate persistence, each \ac{KVS} stores its contents in
a memory-mapped file. To satisfy the consistency requirements shown in Chapter
\ref{ch:nvram-consistency}, it is important to prevent potential buffering of
data in kernel page caches. This is achieved by using a 127GB instance of
\emph{tmpfs} as \ac{RAM} disk. However, even with this setup, memory pages may
still be swapped at will by the operating system. In order to prevent this,
swapping is disabled. As a result, the hard disk is never used and no write
operation within the mapped region is deferred. In accordance with
\cite{bailey2013exploring, zhou2016nvht}, this work refrains from emulating
\ac{NVRAM} latencies for the same reasons given in Chapter
\ref{ch:eval-challenges}.
