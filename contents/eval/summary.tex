% * short recap
% * result
%     * M has better ttp in one scenario (S3) but also does not scale there (promising result, esp. low-contention is where MVCC/SI is preferred)
%         * in other scenarios M performs much worse than echo
%         * performs esp. bad in very high contention scenarios (with up to 99 percent abort rates)
%         * inappropriate data structure
%         * M* attempts to approximate perf. of lock-free hash table
%     * M* has significantly higher throughput and scales well up until 16 cores, while maintaining comparable abort rates
%         * may be too optimistic because concurrent data structures are generally slower than their non-synchronized counterparts
%         * M with a concurrent data strucure may perform worse but still better than echo (in the middle)
%     * E generally has much lower abort rates but only provides snapshot isolation
%         * moreover it fails to leverage the advantage and hardly scales beyond 8 cores
%         * possible reasons include: excessive synchronization and inefficient NVRAM consistency code
% * summary
%     * experiment shows that serializability may become affordable with NVRAM
%         * except in very high contention scenarios, Midas can provide better throughput and scale better than echo
%         * especially in low-contention scenarios (which is where MVCC/SI are best at) and even with high sync overhead Midas can perform better than its non-serializable counterpart echo
