\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{ch:summary}

Recent advances in non-volatile memory research indicate that fast high-density
NVRAM is available in the near future. Based on this prospect, later research
found that novel NVRAM can significantly increase transaction throughput in
databases. Still, for performance reasons, many databases resort to relaxed
isolation of concurrent transactions. Therefore, this thesis investigates if
NVRAM provides sufficient leverage to make the isolation level of
serializability affordable.

For that purpose, Midas, an NVRAM-resident key-value store with serializable
transactions was developed. The concurrency control  in Midas is based on an
extended variant of the MVCC protocol Snapshot Isolation. Non-volatile memory is
managed using PMDK, a state of the art library for programming against NVRAM.

In order to evaluate if the concept of this work is worth pursuing, an
experiment was conducted. In the experiment, Midas is compared to Echo, another
NVRAM-resident KVS but with non-serializable transactions. Both KVS are compared
in terms of transaction throughput and abort rate measured with four different
synthetic workloads.

% * was habe ich gemacht (und warum)
%     * in-memory KVS for NVRAM mit serialisierbaren Transaktionen entworfen
%     * this was achieved with the pmdk library
% * ergebnis zusammenfassen
%     * as expected, serializability reduces ttp drastically in high-contention scenarios
%     * however, with low-medium contention serializability did not perform much worse
% * future work
%     * additional experiments (vs. other serializable impl. or locking-based approaches)
%     * apply concept in full-grown MMDB, or even distributed databases
%     * garbage collection (always problematic when concurrent)
%     * more efficient data structures
%         * concurrent hash table for NVRAM
%         * concurrent histories

% * as MMDB have become ever more common, the bottleneck shifted from IO to memory.
%     * but recovery still uses IO -> bottleneck
%
% * novel NVRAM provides high capacities of fast byte-addressable non-volatile RAM
% * this thesis investigates whether novel NVRAM can be leveraged to enable serializable...
% * this makes sense because
%     * it is shown in SOTA that most MMDB including KVS do not enable serializable isolation levels by default
%     * it is shown in SOTA that NVRAM can significantly reduce recovery overhead and increase ttp hence
