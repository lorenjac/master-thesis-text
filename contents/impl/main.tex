\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:impl}

In this chapter a prototype implementation of the concept introduced in Chapter
\ref{ch:concept} is presented. The chapter is divided in three sections. By
showing a few usage examples, the first part gives an impression on how the
implemented \ac{KVS} can be used. The second part deals with the architecture of
Midas and outlines selected topics such as NVRAM handling and the components
involved in transaction management. The last section delves into the details of
transaction processing and the underlying algorithms. In order to make
addressing the \ac{KVS} more convenient, it is henceforth referred to by its
working title \emph{Midas} \footnotemark.

\footnotetext{The name is taken from Greek mythology. According to the legend,
King Midas was given the ability to turn everything he touches into gold. This
resembles the idea of making information non-volatile as in \ac{NVRAM}.}
