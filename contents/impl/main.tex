In this chapter a prototypical implementation of the concept introduced in Chapter \ref{ch:concept} is presented. The chapter is divided into two sections. By showing a few usage examples, the first part gives an impression on how the implemented KVS can be used. The second part deals with the architecture and selected implementation details.
