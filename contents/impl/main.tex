\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:impl}

In this chapter a prototypical implementation of the concept introduced in
Chapter \ref{ch:concept} is presented. The chapter is divided in two sections.
By showing a few usage examples, the first part gives an impression on how the
implemented KVS can be used. The second part deals with the architecture and
selected implementation details. In order to make addressing the KVS more
convenient, it is henceforth referred to by its working title \emph{Midas}
\footnotemark.

\footnotetext{The name is taken from Greek mythology. According to the legend,
King Midas was given the ability to turn everything he touches into gold. This
resembles the idea of making information non-volatile as in NVRAM.}
