\section{Basics}

% introduce fundamental terms and concepts about key-value stores and 
% transaction processing

% focus is on management of concurrent transactions
% => ensure data consistency and recoverability

\subsection{Key-Value Stores}

% Definition (DB -> KVS: no queries, no schema, single associative collection)

% Structure / API (???)

\subsection{Transactions}

% Definition (versch. Arten: flat, nested, distributed)

% Eigenschaften -> ACID (Isolation/Serialization spÃ¤ter!)

% Modellierung (bound to ADTs, bound to memory = STM)

\subsection{Concurrency Control}

% Problem -> Race Conditions -> Conflicts (RW, WR, WW)

% Task -> ensure consistency, recover when in doubt

% Serializability

% Methods (Locking, MVCC: Snapshot Isolation)
