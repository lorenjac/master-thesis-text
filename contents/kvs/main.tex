\chapter{Key-Value Stores}
\label{ch:kvs}

% Context

Recent research suggests the use of novel non-volatile memory as persistent
main memory. Apart from being byte-addressable, the upcoming modules are
projected to be almost as fast as DRAM and provide a higher capacity. Among
others, this could have considerable consequences for databases such as
key-value stores. Imagine recovery without retrieving checkpoints from disk.
Nevertheless, this work aims to assess the influence of NVRAM on the design of
concurrency control.

% Overview (coarse)

This chapter provides a brief overview on key-value stores with regard to
upcoming NVRAM. But before giving insight into the current state of the art,
a few fundamental terms must be introduced. For this purpose the chapter has
been separated into two parts.

% Overview (fine)

The first part introduces the concept of key-value stores with an emphasis on
managing concurrent transactions. Important aspects in this regard are
concurrency control and serializability. In the second part, a comprehensive
analysis on novel non-volatile memory and modern key-value stores is conducted.
