\chapter{Key-Value Stores}
\label{ch:kvs}

A prominent use case for NVRAM are main-memory databases. Even though main
memory and processor caches have become more affordable, MMDB still suffer from
recovery on slower disk drives \cite{oukid2015instant, schwalb2016hyrise}. NVRAM
on the other hand, provides an opportunity to eliminate recovery altogether. An
important class of databases often implemented as MMDB is KVS. Due to their
simplicity and low overhead, KVS have been adopted both in big-data computing
and database research \cite{decandia2007dynamo, lakshman2010cassandra,
wang2015hydradb}. In recent works, KVS were used to explore database design for
NVRAM \cite{bailey2013exploring, zhou2016nvht, wu2016nvmcached}.

This chapter provides a domain analysis of KVS. First, a brief overview of KVS
is given. The aim of this work is to exploit NVRAM for a KVS with fast
conflict-free concurrent transactions. Therefore, a substantial part of the
remaining chapter is dedicated to transactions and concurrency control. The
chapter is concluded with an examination of existing KVS for NVRAM.

\paragraph{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item KVS are vital database technology; esp. distributed but beyond scope
    \item performance can be increased through in-memory operation + concurrency
    \item a widely-adopted concurrency control is MVCC; but most impl. non-ser.
    \item KVS for NVRAM have shown some potential over traditional KVS
    \item recent KVS for NVRAM all non-ser. => leverage boost to provide ser.
\end{itemize}
